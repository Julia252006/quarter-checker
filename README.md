##Quarter Checker

<span>A simple JavaScript project with allows
 to identify a point quarter based on
 input value of its 'x' and 'y' axis.</span>
 
 Here is its code:
 ```javascript 
 if (isNaN(x) || isNaN(y)) {
         print ('Some coordinate was passer with in correct value!');
     }
 if (x == '' || y == ''){
     print ('Point coordinate value is empty!');
 }
  if (x > 0 && y > 0) {
     print('Point is in the first QUARTER');
  }
   else if (x < 0 && y > 0) {
      print('Point is in the second QUARTER');
  }
   else if (x < 0 && y < 0) {
      print('Point is in the third QUARTER');
  }
   else if (x > 0 && y < 0) {
      print('Point is in the fourth QUARTER');
  }
   else if (x == 0 && y > 0) {
      print('Point is in the first and second QUARTER');
  }
   else if (x == 0 && y < 0) {
      print('Point is in the third and fourth QUARTER');
  }
   else if (x > 0 && y == 0) {
      print('Point is in the first and fourth QUARTER');
  }
   else if (x < 0 && y == 0) {
       print('Point is in the third and second QUARTER');
  }
   else if (x == 0 && y == 0) {
       print('Point is in all QUARTER');
  }
```
